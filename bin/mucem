=head1 NAME

mucem - is a very simple TUI to compose a mail header (mblaze or mutt format)
over fuzzy searching on a mu cfind dump.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

in your C<.muttrc>, add

    set edit_headers=yes

in your C<ftplugin/mail.vim>, add

    nnoremap ,r r!mucem

now you can type C<,r> from vim to select recipients.

=head1 TODO

    * add a cache? (when reindexing? hook something?)

=head1 FAQ

=head2 no undo ?

nope: it's easier to fix things afterward

=head2 Known Bugs

from time to time, mucem seems to break tilix and i have to use the reset
command to fix it.
